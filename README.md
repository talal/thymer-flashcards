# Thymer Flashcards Plugin

A spaced repetition flashcards plugin for [Thymer](https://thymer.com) powered by [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs) (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler).

Create flashcards directly inside your notes using a simple `Question :: Answer` syntax, then practice them with Anki-style spaced repetition.

## Installation

### From GitHub Release (recommended)

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/talal/thymer-flashcards/releases/latest)
2. Download `plugin.js` and `plugin.json`
3. In Thymer, open Command Palette (`Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`) → **Plugins** → **Create Plugin**
4. Paste the contents of `plugin.js` into **Custom Code**
5. Paste the contents of `plugin.json` into **Configuration**
6. Save

### From Source

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions.

## Flashcard Syntax

Write flashcards anywhere in your notes using the `::` separator:

```
Capital of France? :: Paris
Who created this plugin? :: Claude
```

Each line containing `::` with non-empty text on both sides is treated as a flashcard.

## Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`) and search for:

### Flashcards: Generate

Scans **all notes** in your workspace for lines matching the `Question :: Answer` pattern. New flashcards are initialized with FSRS metadata so they'll appear in your next practice session. Already-tracked flashcards are left untouched.

Run this after adding new flashcards to your notes.

### Flashcards: Practice

Opens a practice panel showing all flashcards that are currently due for review. For each card:

1. The **question** is shown first
2. Click the card or press `Space` to **reveal the answer**
3. Rate your recall:
   - **Again** (`1`) — Forgot completely, review again soon
   - **Hard** (`2`) — Recalled with significant difficulty
   - **Good** (`3`) — Recalled correctly with some effort
   - **Easy** (`4`) — Recalled instantly, no effort needed

Each button shows the predicted next review interval. After rating, the FSRS algorithm updates the card's schedule and the next card is shown.

A summary screen is displayed when all due cards have been reviewed.

## How It Works

- Flashcard metadata (due date, stability, difficulty, repetition count, etc.) is stored as **meta properties directly on each line item** in your notes
- The [FSRS algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs) schedules reviews based on your ratings, optimizing for ~90% retention
- Cards start in the **New** state and progress through **Learning → Review** as you practice
- Forgotten cards enter a **Relearning** phase with shorter intervals

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Practice Panel)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Reveal answer |
| `1` | Rate: Again |
| `2` | Rate: Hard |
| `3` | Rate: Good |
| `4` | Rate: Easy |

## FSRS Defaults

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target retention | 90% |
| Maximum interval | 365 days |
| Fuzzing | Enabled |
| Short-term learning | Enabled |
| Learning steps | 1m, 10m |
| Relearning steps | 10m |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Creation
  - [x] Single-line basic (one direction) cards
  - [ ] Bidirectional cards — front and reverse directions
  - [ ] Multi-line cards
  - [ ] Dashboard
  - [ ] Cloze (fill-in-the-blank) cards
  - [ ] Image occlusion — select areas of image which become flashcards
  - [ ] AI support
    - [ ] Generate cards from note content
    - [ ] Add front of the card (i.e. the question) and the answer gets generated by AI.
- [ ] Reviewing
  - [ ] Global practice — review all cards
  - [ ] Note practice — review cards belonging to a specific note
  - [ ] Collection practice — review cards belonging to a specific collection
- [ ] Maintenance
  - [ ] Recompute card schedules
  - [ ] Optimize FSRS weights — parameters which control how long FSRS waits before showing you cards again
